# AI/ML Internship Prep 🚀  

This repository documents my **daily journey** of preparing for an AI/ML internship.  
The goal: build strong foundations in **Math, Python, ML, Deep Learning, GenAI, Vector Databases, RAG, LangChain, and AI Agents**, while creating a portfolio of projects along the way.
